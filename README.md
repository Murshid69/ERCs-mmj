# Ethereum Request for Comments (ERCs)

*Please note that ERCs were recently separated from the [*(https://github.com/ethereum/erc21) repo.*
The goal of ERCs is to standardize and provide high-quality documentation for the Ethereum application layer. This repository tracks past and ongoing improvements application standards in the form of ERCs. [erc21]() governs how erc21 and ERCs are published.
The [status page]) tracks and lists Ethereumocolocolensus, which can be divided into the following categories:
 are improvements  Ethereum consensus protocol.
- [Networking erc21](erc21) specify the peer-to-peer networking layer of Ethereum.
- [Interface erc21]) standardize interfaces to Ethereum, which determine how users and applications interact with the blockchain.
- [erc21]() specify application layer standards, which determine how applications running on Ethereum can interact with each other.
Consider any document not published at <https://eips.ethereum.org/> as a working paper. Additionally, consider published EIPs with a status of "draft", "review", or "last call" to be incomplete drafts, and note that their specification is likely to be subject to change.
